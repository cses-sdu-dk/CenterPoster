\begin{block}{Occupant Behaviour versus Energy Consumption}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] Definition: Occupant behavior covers all actions of the occupant (including presence) that affect building energy consumption.
  \item[-] Occupant behavior determines a large share of the energy consumption of buildings.
  \item[-] Information about occupant behavior provides a mean for software-based building applications to optimize this share.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{OccuRE: A Platform for Occupancy REasoning}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] OccuRE is a software platform that enables flexible estimation and prediction of occupancy behavior.
  \item[-] OccuRE provides an application programming interface (API) for calculating and accessing occupancy information
  \item[-] The platform implements a wide selection of algorithms for occupancy behavior based on sensor fusion, machine learning and prediction algorithms.
  \item[-] The platform is being developed from TRL2 to TRL6 over the coming years
\end{itemize}
